/**
 * TestnetLocalSigner — DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY.
 *
 * NEVER use this in production. This class exists for local development and
 * automated tests against the Stellar TESTNET. It loads a Stellar secret key
 * from an environment variable and keeps it in memory for the process's lifetime.
 *
 * SECURITY GUARANTEES:
 * - The secret key is read ONLY from the environment variable
 *   `STELLAR_TESTNET_SECRET_KEY`.
 * - The secret key is NEVER written to disk, logs, API responses, or
 *   error messages.
 * - The secret key is NEVER exposed through the Signer interface — only the
 *   public account ID is available externally.
 * - The LLM / agent layer never receives a reference to this object. It is
 *   held by the pipeline, which is the only code path that invokes sign().
 *
 * FINAL WALLET ARCHITECTURE (not this class):
 * - UserWalletSigner   — user-custodied wallet signing (e.g. WalletConnect / xBull / Freighter)
 * - AgentPermissionSigner — scoped on-chain signer with an on-chain policy contract
 * - HardwareSigner / KmsSigner — hardware-backed or cloud-KMS-backed signing
 *
 * Those are interfaces today; they will be implemented when their
 * requirements are concrete. Do not build them prematurely.
