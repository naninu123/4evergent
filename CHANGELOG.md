# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Atomic execution claim via `updateIfStatus(queued→executing)` CAS to prevent concurrent workers from executing the same record (Phase 18A)
- Idempotency-Key header support for `POST /agents/:id/intents` to prevent duplicate financial execution from repeated API requests (Phase 18B)
- Horizon pre-check mitigation before blind retry — guards against duplicate submission when original transaction may have reached Horizon (Phase 18C)

### Added
- `ExecutionRecord.submittedHash` field persisted on all pipeline paths for pre-check identification
- `ExecutionQueue.preCheck` option for pluggable transaction status verification
- `PreCheckFn` / `PreCheckResult` types for adapter-level integration
- `StellarAdapter.getTransactionStatus()` used as preCheck implementation in API server

### Changed
- `StellarSubmitter.submit()` error now preserves `preSubmitHash` for recovery/reconciliation
- `TransactionPipeline` carries `idempotencyKey` through all execution paths
- `ActivityStore.recordIdempotent()` for atomic key-based reservation

### Documentation
- Phase 19A: refreshed README, CONTRIBUTING, security-model, architecture, testnet docs
- Added SECURITY.md, issue templates, PR template
