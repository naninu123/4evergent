/**
 * ExecutionRecoveryService — scans persisted ExecutionStore for records stuck in
 * "executing" state (e.g., process crashed mid-execution) and moves them to
 * "failed" with an immediate `nextRetryAt` so the existing ExecutionQueue worker
 * can pick them up for retry.
 *
 * SEMANTICS:
 *   - Does NOT create duplicate records.
 *   - Does NOT reset retry count (preserves existing `attempt`).
 *   - Does NOT execute transactions directly — only changes persisted state.
 *   - Records already in a terminal state (submitted, confirmed, failed,
 *     dead_letter) or queued are NOT touched.
 *   - Idempotent: calling recover() multiple times on the same store is safe;
 *     once a record is moved out of "executing", it is no longer eligible.
 *
 * CRASH LIMITATION:
 *   Recovery can only address the LOCAL persisted state. If a transaction was
 *   actually submitted to the network before the crash but the local record was
 *   still in "executing", the transaction may have executed on-chain even though
 *   local state shows "failed" after recovery.  This is a fundamental
 *   network-vs-local ambiguity and is NOT exactly-once safe without an
 *   external confirmation/idempotency mechanism (documented as a limitation).
